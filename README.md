# Python Image Classifying Model

This guide will walk you through creating a Python image classification model using Keras.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Pillow

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Prepare Your Data:**

   Organize your images into categories (e.g., 'cats' and 'notcats'). Ensure you have a sufficient number of images for training.

2. **Load and Preprocess Data:**

   Use OpenCV to load and preprocess images. Resize them to a consistent size and convert them to grayscale.

3. **Build Your Model:**

   Design your convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture using Keras. Below is a sample model:

   ```python
   from keras.models import Sequential
   from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten
   from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D
   from tensorflow.keras.layers import BatchNormalization

   def create_model():
       model = Sequential()
       # Add layers to your model
       # Example architecture:
       # (Conv2D -> MaxPooling2D -> BatchNormalization) * n
       # Flatten -> Dense -> Dropout -> Dense
       return model

   model = create_model()

   ```
